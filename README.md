# xserver

A simple block that runs an X server for GUI applications. This block uses [matchbox window manager](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/usenix03/tech/freenix03/full_papers/allum/allum_html/matchbox.html) by default.

## Usage

Set the `DISPLAY` variable in your application to `localhost:0` before running any GUI applications
